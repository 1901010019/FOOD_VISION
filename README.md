# FOOD_VISION
food_vision_project, data taken from tensorflow. it had been trained on 101 different food classes


# TABLE OF CONTENT
* Fine tuned deep learning model using tensorflow food 101 dataset.
* Experimenting with how our traditional machine learning algorithms would perform on the food 101 image dataset.
* Technologies used



# FINE TUNED MODEL USING NEURAL NET

after a lot of experimentation, we have come to a final conclusion ( in this case our trained model ) and had saved it to google drive. i have uploaded the trained model here in this repository.
